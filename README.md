Find All Duplicates
Write a function (in python) or method (in Java) that accepts a list of integers and returns a list of only those integers that appear more than once:

def find_duplicates(l: list) -> list:
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(l)):
            if l[i] == l[j] and l[i] not in duplicates:
                duplicates.append(l[i])
    return duplicates


Describe Different Approaches to Solving This Problem
Describe the two different ways to figure out all of the duplicate values of a list of integers in english. The first solution is the nested loop solution. The second solution is to use a dictionary or a map (similar to the containsPair method we wrote in class. Describe both in as much detail as you can (with no code) and describe the trade-offs between the two solutions:

With a nested loop, you compare each number to every other number and record any repeats. It's simple but slow, since it has to check lots of pairs. Using a dictionary or set keeps track of numbers youâ€™ve seen as you go, and if you see the same number again, you mark it as a duplicate. Probably faster since you only look at each number once, but it uses extra memory.
